  "description": "A system of equations is a set of two or more equations that share the same variables. Solving a system of equations means finding a set of values for the variables that simultaneously satisfy all equations in the system. Geometrically, for a system of two linear equations with two variables, the solution represents the point(s) of intersection of their graphs.",

    "Simultaneous Equations: All equations in the system must be true for the same set of variable values.",
    "Solution: An ordered set of values (e.g., an ordered pair (x,y) for two variables, an ordered triple (x,y,z) for three) that satisfies every equation in the system.",
    "Consistent System: A system that has at least one solution.",
    "Inconsistent System: A system that has no solution (e.g., parallel lines that never intersect).",
    "Dependent System: A system that has infinitely many solutions (e.g., two equations representing the same line).",
    "Independent System: A consistent system with exactly one solution."
