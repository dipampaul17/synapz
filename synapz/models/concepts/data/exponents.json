  "description": "Exponents indicate how many times a base number is multiplied by itself. For example, in b\u207f, 'b' is the base and 'n' is the exponent. Logarithms are the inverse operation of exponentiation. The logarithm of a number 'x' to a base 'b' (written as log\u2098(x)) is the exponent to which 'b' must be raised to produce 'x'. They are crucial for solving exponential equations and analyzing phenomena with exponential growth or decay.",
