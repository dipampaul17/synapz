  "description": "Factoring a polynomial means expressing it as a product of simpler polynomials (its factors). It is the reverse process of expanding or multiplying polynomials. Factoring is a crucial skill for solving polynomial equations, simplifying rational expressions, and understanding the behavior of polynomial functions (e.g., finding roots/x-intercepts).",

    "Factor: A polynomial that divides another polynomial evenly (with no remainder).",
    "Prime Polynomial: A polynomial that cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree with integer coefficients (analogous to prime numbers).",
    "Greatest Common Factor (GCF): The largest monomial that is a factor of each term of the polynomial. Always try to factor out the GCF first.",
    "Zero Product Property: If the product of two or more factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. This is used when solving factored polynomial equations (e.g., if (x-a)(x-b)=0, then x-a=0 or x-b=0)."
