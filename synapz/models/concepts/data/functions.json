  "description": "A relation is a set of ordered pairs (x, y), showing a relationship between two sets of values. A function is a special type of relation where every input value (x, from the domain) is associated with exactly one output value (y, from the range). Functions are fundamental to mathematics and are used to model real-world phenomena where one quantity depends on another.",
  "key_ideas": [
    "Relation: Any set of ordered pairs. Can be represented by a set of points, a table, a graph, or a mapping diagram.",
    "Function: A relation where each input (x-value) has only one unique output (y-value). Passes the Vertical Line Test (a vertical line drawn on the graph intersects the function at most once).",
    "Domain: The set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined.",
    "Range: The set of all possible output values (y-values) that the function can produce.",
    "Function Notation: f(x), read as \"f of x\", represents the output of function 'f' for a given input 'x'. 'x' is the independent variable, and f(x) (or y) is the dependent variable.",
    "Independent Variable: The input to a function, usually denoted by x.",
    "Dependent Variable: The output of a function, usually denoted by y or f(x), as its value depends on the input."
