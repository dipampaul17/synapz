  "description": "A sequence is an ordered list of numbers, called terms, that follow a specific rule or pattern. A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence. Understanding sequences and series is important for analyzing patterns, predicting future values, and in areas like calculus (infinite series) and finance (annuities).",
