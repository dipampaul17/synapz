  "description": "A linear equation is a fundamental concept in algebra representing a statement that two linear expressions are equal. A linear expression involves variables to the first power (e.g., x, not xÂ²). Solving a linear equation means finding the specific value(s) for the variable(s) that make the statement true. These equations typically graph as straight lines when plotted on a coordinate plane (e.g., y = mx + c).",
  "key_ideas": [
    "Equality: The core principle is that both sides of the equation must always remain equal.",
    "Inverse Operations: To isolate the variable, apply inverse operations (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division) to both sides of the equation.",
    "Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Applied in reverse when solving (SADMEP/SAMDOB).",
    "One Variable vs. Two Variables: Linear equations can involve one variable (e.g., 3x + 1 = 7) or two variables (e.g., y = 2x - 1), the latter often representing lines."
