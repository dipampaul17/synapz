  "description": "A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation in a single variable x, with the standard form ax² + bx + c = 0, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are coefficients (real numbers) and 'a' is not equal to zero. The solutions to a quadratic equation are called its roots or zeros, which are the x-values where the corresponding quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c intersects the x-axis. Quadratic equations graph as parabolas.",

    "Standard Form: ax² + bx + c = 0 (where a ≠ 0).",
    "Coefficients: 'a' (leading coefficient), 'b' (linear coefficient), 'c' (constant term).",
    "Roots/Zeros: The values of x that satisfy the equation. A quadratic equation can have two distinct real roots, one repeated real root, or two complex conjugate roots.",
    "Parabola: The U-shaped graph of a quadratic function. The parabola opens upwards if a > 0 and downwards if a < 0.",
    "Vertex: The highest or lowest point of the parabola.",
    "Axis of Symmetry: A vertical line that divides the parabola into two mirror images, passing through the vertex. Equation: x = -b/(2a).",
    "Discriminant (Δ): The part of the quadratic formula under the square root, Δ = b² - 4ac. It determines the nature of the roots:",
    "  - If Δ > 0: Two distinct real roots.",
    "  - If Δ = 0: One repeated real root (or two equal real roots).",
    "  - If Δ < 0: Two complex conjugate roots (no real roots)."
