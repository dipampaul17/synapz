  "description": "An inequality is a mathematical statement that compares two expressions using an inequality symbol. Unlike equations which state equality, inequalities express that one quantity is greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to another. Solving an inequality means finding all values of the variable that make the inequality true. The solution set is often represented as an interval on a number line.",
  "key_ideas": [
    "Inequality Symbols: < (less than), > (greater than), ≤ (less than or equal to), ≥ (greater than or equal to), ≠ (not equal to).",
    "Solution Set: The set of all numbers that satisfy the inequality. This is often an interval of numbers rather than a single value.",
    "Properties of Inequalities: Similar to equations, you can add or subtract the same quantity to both sides. You can multiply or divide both sides by the same positive quantity.",
    "Flipping the Sign: When multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality symbol must be reversed.",
    "Graphing Inequalities: Solutions can be graphed on a number line. Open circles (o) are used for < and >; closed circles (●) are used for ≤ and ≥.",
    "Compound Inequalities: Two or more inequalities joined by 'and' or 'or' (e.g., -2 < x ≤ 5, or x < 0 or x > 3)."
