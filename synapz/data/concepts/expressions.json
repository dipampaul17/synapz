  "description": "An algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase that combines numbers (constants), variables (letters representing unknown values), and operational symbols (+, -, ×, ÷, exponents). Unlike an equation, an algebraic expression does not contain an equals sign and therefore cannot be 'solved' for a specific value of the variable (though it can be evaluated if the variable's value is known, or simplified). Expressions are the building blocks of equations and inequalities.",
  "key_ideas": [
    "Variable: A symbol (usually a letter like x, y, or a) that represents an unknown quantity or a quantity that can change.",
    "Constant: A fixed numerical value (e.g., 5, -2, π).",
    "Term: A single number, a variable, or numbers and variables multiplied together. Terms are separated by + or - signs (e.g., in 3x + 2y - 5, the terms are 3x, 2y, and -5).",
    "Coefficient: The numerical factor of a term that contains a variable (e.g., in 3x, the coefficient is 3).",
    "Like Terms: Terms that have the exact same variable(s) raised to the exact same power(s) (e.g., 3x² and -5x² are like terms, but 3x and 3x² are not).",
    "Simplifying Expressions: Combining like terms to make the expression shorter and easier to understand.",
    "Evaluating Expressions: Substituting a specific value for each variable and calculating the result."
  ],
  "types_of_expressions": [
    "Monomial: An expression with only one term (e.g., 5x, 7, -2ab²).",
    "Binomial: An expression with two terms (e.g., 3x + 2, a² - b²).",
    "Trinomial: An expression with three terms (e.g., x² + 5x + 6, 2a - 3b + c).",
    "Polynomial: An expression with one or more terms, where exponents on variables are non-negative integers."
